                <p>Hi! My name is Ryan Borba and I'm an aspiring college student looking to code for a living. I’m not entirely sure what I want to do yet but I do know that I genuinely enjoy coding and problem solving. Coding can be very daunting and sometimes stressful but it’s always worth it when you finally succeed in something you were struggling with for a while. Even this page you’re looking at was sort of a challenge for me. As of the time of typing this, I don’t even really know how I want this page to look but I’ll figure it out. I’ve been learning HTML and CSS on my own and it has allowed me to create this fantastic website. I sometimes enjoy writing short stories as a hobby and I’ve managed to write multiple so far. I completed one named “Castle of Karth” in highschool, and another called “Thorns”. Other than that, I have an ongoing one called “Distant Lands” that I’ve written thousands of words on but have yet to get back to. I’ve never been much of a sports person but I do occasionally watch E-Sports as I find them entertaining. I like watching pro-play for Valorant, Rocket League, and even Dead by Daylight.

                <p>As a person, I’ve grown and learned a lot from a game called Dark Souls 1. In short, the general idea of the game is that it’s difficult but fair. Your goal is to persevere and conquer all challenges. A lot of people don’t really understand the impact this game had on my life. For many people, games are a time waster, and as I’ve matured, I’d say this is only partially true. Games can teach you valuable lessons. For me, Dark Souls 1 taught me that you can achieve things that you once thought were impossible; you just have to try. Obviously, passion is a big influencer for me and I tend to have a hard time being productive when I’m not passionate about what I’m doing. However, with something like coding which I genuinely have a passion for, I’m willing to try over and over again until I learn and improve as a developer. I know that I have the capabilities starting today to forge myself a bright future and I plan on slowly getting there with effort and hard work. I truly believe that if I never picked up this game at the age of nine years old, I'd be a different person. Everything that used to be difficult in the game is now very easy to me and it's because I put in the effort of nearly mastering it.

                <p>As for my history in education, and what I’ve learned along the journey, I started off in El Dorado Hills which is a county in California. Elementary school isn’t really much to talk about, and neither is middle school. I started pursuing Dentistry at Lodi High School where I aimed to get a 4.0 for the last few years as a junior and senior. I got great grades but had no social life and constantly felt dumber than the rest of the kids even though I got that 4.0. I didn’t even rank particularly high in the class either unfortunately. I went to the University of Reno, Nevada and continued my pursuit of becoming a dentist. I honestly just felt a lot of pressure from my parents and I didn’t know what to do with myself when I started failing. I got a 4.0 the first year of college with straight As, and then proceeded to quickly lose my interest for anything dentistry related as the years passed. Even after my 60 hours or so of shadowing dentists and watching them do their work, I just ended up a very depressed person. I wasted years of my life taking science courses that brought me unnecessary stress when I could’ve been learning computer science related topics from the start. At the end of my junior year at UNR, I shifted over to online school back in California with Arizona State University. So far I haven’t taken too many courses, but from the looks of it, I’m not too greatly concerned. I’ve never struggled in a mathematics class before so I have no doubts that I’ll do well. Additionally, I’m sure some of that information that I’ll learn will come in handy. I’m much happier now and I’m generally a healthier person since I’ve switched.

                <p>You might be wondering though, “Why? What caused that switch to coding of all things?”. The answer is pretty simple. I took an introductory to C# course with Alan Yang who was my professor at the time. I immediately fell in love with coding and my appreciation for Mr. Yang teaching me how to code in C# is something I can barely put into words. He kickstarted me on this journey and I’ve always wanted to learn how to code and make programs. I just didn’t know it until I learned from him in his class. However, it was thanks to his teaching style that I found myself enjoying coding. He allowed me to be creative and he encouraged me to try more difficult concepts than the rest of the class. I know I’m being extremely humble, but I was the only person alongside one other kid who never failed to figure out a single one of Mr. Yang’s prompts that he would put on the board every other day or so. Those prompts were a perfect learning experience for me personally. I was even incentivized due to my new coding skills to pursue the creation of Forsaken Dungeon Chronicles; a project that you can find on the ‘Projects’ page. Although the creation of the project has halted and I’ve jumped to working on other things like this website, it is still something that I will return to someday and finish.
