                <p>As a person, I’ve grown and learned a lot from a game called Dark Souls 1. In short, the general idea of the game is that it’s difficult but fair. Your goal is to persevere and conquer all challenges. A lot of people don’t really understand the impact this game had on my life. For many people, games are a time waster, and as I’ve matured, I’d say this is only partially true. Games can teach you valuable lessons. For me, Dark Souls 1 taught me that you can achieve things that you once thought were impossible; you just have to try. Obviously, passion is a big influencer for me and I tend to have a hard time being productive when I’m not passionate about what I’m doing. However, with something like coding which I genuinely have a passion for, I’m willing to try over and over again until I learn and improve as a developer. I know that I have the capabilities starting today to forge myself a bright future and I plan on slowly getting there with effort and hard work. I truly believe that if I never picked up this game at the age of nine years old, I'd be a different person. Everything that used to be difficult in the game is now very easy to me and it's because I put in the effort of nearly mastering it.
