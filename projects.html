          Forsaken Dungeon Chronicles is a unique and well thought out dungeon
          crawler coded in C# that I've been working on for a while now. It
          contains a pathfinding algorithm that works on the grid I supplied it.
          It's used to find the stamina needed for entities on the board to move
          to specific squares. I mention the pathfinder specifically because
          it's the coolest thing I've coded without any outside assistance. The
          grid is also completely randomized in size (width and height) and the
          pathfinder still works with that. This was the first project I ever
          took on and I have yet to finish it. Click the widget to learn more!

          I could talk about Dark Souls 1 for hours as it's one of my favorite
          games of all time. I'll keep this explanation short though and
          elaborate on it on it's own page. This project really means a lot to
          me because it was my first ever time using Github and creating a
          custom exe file for a mod. I needed some help with it because Dark
          Souls 1 uses it's own repository called SoulsFormats to help with
          editing things within the game. Eventually though, I was able to
          iterate through every instance of an enemy in the game for as many
          times the user desired. Click the widget to learn more!

          I initially got inspired to make this because I wanted to know how
          many duplicated bosses the game "Elden Ring" by FromSoftware had. The
          findings were surprising and I even double checked them. I was able to
          find the duplicates and display a neat list of the unique values with
          the number of duplicates next to them. This program works for whatever
          kind of list you want though just as long as it comes from a text file
          where each line is a new item. I'll probably be utilizing this tool
          someday so it was a great project to work on. Click the widget to

          This project was a quick one but it still taught me a few things about
          how to use the image class in C# with visual studios. I've never
          messed around with anything regarding images in coding before so this
          was a nice exercise in order for me to learn a thing or two about
          image manipulation. This program simply randomizes the location of
          every single pixel within the original image. It also does this while
          maintaining the original image location which is really nice. Click

          So here we are goofing around and having fun with images in C#. I'm
          not SUPER proud of this program as I didn't really get the result I
          wanted, but it still (kind of) makes gradients from an image. You can
          even see how goofy it looks with the random orange splashes on the
          above example. This happened because I sorted by RGB values and not
          necessarily by any other measure. This made it so that colors wouldn't
          match well with others but their brightness would be pretty solid.

          Halloween was rolling around so I thought I'd make a website about
          bidding on whether you'd get scared or not. It sounded like a really
          fun idea and I've been working through a full stack development course
          in order to learn things like Javascript. I've wanted to learn JS for
          a long time and this project was my way of dipping my toes in it. I
          definitely had a rough time getting things going but I'm incredibly
          happy with the current progress on the website. Ideally I'll upload it
          when it's all said and done. Click the widget to learn more!

          I don't even recall how I came up with this idea in all honesty but I
          thought it would be nice to have one dedicated place for all of my exe
          files. I can search which ones I want, and so forth. So I made this
          python application in order to have quick access to exes. It also
          clears up my navigation bar at the bottom. Click the widget to learn

          Just a fun little project using AI not only in the creation of the
          program itself but in the actual functioning of the program. Really
          interesting concept that I want to do more with since my biggest issue
          is popular AIs online running out of memory. The whole point of using
          a local AI was for that to not happen. Click the widget to learn more!
