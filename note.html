                <p id = "dungeon-description">Dear Ryan, it's your 2024 self talking. Hopefully it's been a while since you've seen this. Maybe a few years. Maybe more. 
                    I'm writing this message to you so that you can look back on the aspirations that you had and hopefully you reached them.
                    In regards to your career, I really hope you're okay. I hope your mental health is steady and I hope you're staying physically active.
                    I hope that you became the full stack developer that you so badly wanted to be all that time ago. I'm intimidated now and even scared
                    about what my future holds but I hope you can sit down and say you've made it. You have a lot of good qualities. You're very creative,
                    intelligent, and well spoken. I'm sure people have appreciated those aspects about you as time has passed and you've gone further along
                    in your career. Nobody is perfect though, and if you're struggling then it's okay. Right now I really don't know a whole lot. As you
                    can see, I'm playing around a bit with CSS and HTML. As you know, I've coded in C#. I wonder if it's still your favorite coding language.
                    Do you still think Java is garbage? Okay maybe it's not that bad but damn what a headache. I wonder what you've been up to. Maybe
                    you made your own business or maybe you've created some insanely impressive programs and applications that make the world a better
                    place. Without knowing you now, it's hard to say what will happen. I hope that you become the man you've always wanted to be and you
                    have to remember that you're always loved. Keep up the good work. You will know the day in which you're allowed to read this message
                    again.
